      <h1>Freshman Year!!!</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">For freshman year I did a lot of projects at school. Going to list all the project that I have done since freshman year and going to talk about every single one of them. Number 1 did a homeless video. Second is the commercial that we like. Number three was a company that never existed before yet. Now going to talk about every single one and mainly about. For the homeless, we work in groups like 4 to 5 people. That project was mainly about helping out the homeless, and care about them that makes us look good on us. Second is the commercial is that we can mainly talk about what we know, and what we like about it. The last one is the logo. We work in groups of 3 to 4 people. We come up an idea that never exists and represents that company logo. For all these projects I learn is that good or the future that getting ready for a job interview, talking to people, remembered the line so that helps us to remember what to say.</h5>

      <h1>Sophomore Year!!!</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">For a sophomore year, we did a lot of projects. Going to list all the project that I have done since sophomore year and going to talk about every single one of them. Number 1 is Don’t drive and text project. Number two is animation in flash. The very last one was Invasion of Poland. For the project of don’t text and drive project was mainly about telling people about not doing while driving. So we can learn from there, and so can everyone else. The animation in flash was trying to animate our pictures/ objects that we made in adobe illustrator. That was the challenge from there. The very last project was an invasion of Poland that we had to work with one person, and do information about it. Then when we get all the information we put online so our teacher can see it. It’s like a template but not HTML, and CSS. </h5>

      <h1>Junior Year!!!</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">For the junior year, we did a lot of projects. Going to list all the project that I have done since junior year and going to talk about every single one of them. Number one is Company Earth. Number two is Plate Tectonics Project. Number three is App challenge. Number four is a robot. Number five is working with Wordpress. Number six is Database. Number seven math/ English website. Number eight is banner ads of a site. Number nine the last one is English/History from. Now going to talk about every single one of them. For the company earth it was in Graphic Design. We first keep up an idea that support the client about the logo, the site, and much more. There was four of us in a team. Pretend to work for a client. So we made a logo, site, and much more that support the company. The second one is the plate tectonics project is that make our tissue boxes of information about plate tectonics. Everyone work individually formats there. Trying to make unique boxes of information. That helps us to know how does it work from the structure of it. App challenge was that make an app that never exists and can help out from the future from there. Our teacher makes us do that because they were a contest of it. From there everyone had 3 to 4 people in a group. Everyone brain storm to have an idea and how to make from there. It was fun doing for this project and everyone receives certification from Joe Heck. The robot was to show how can they using code from there, and trying to make them want to be in Web from the future. Word Press that we were in a group of four and from there it was mainly about helping out students to pass their semester exam, quiz, test and much more. Mostly like a practice test of English and Math. Database design was something that we learn about and learn how to use it. We were in a group of 3 and make a database of a site like a category of things like a shopping site. Banner ads on our site that we make in Graphic Design. Not making the site just making the banner ads of a challenge to use in the future like some site have ads all the time. Trying to do that. English/History project video was mainly about a poem that we have selected for the topic and have to be filmed from there. Working with 4- 5 people in a group. Have to make a poem not just only sentence making it interesting. That’s all the project that I can think of at this time. Did one year of Key Club and helping out the community service and receive a certification of joining the key club for 1 year. For community serve we did was 50 hours. Doing next year too. The last one was that used to work in the cafeteria for helping out and the community from there Would say about a 1 year and a half. For the past three years been improving my grammars and got helped by my English teacher. </h5>
